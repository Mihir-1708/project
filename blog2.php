		<h3><u>1. Consistency</u></h3>
		<p class="section-text" style="text-align: justify;">
		Consistency is key to achieve the results you desire. Just like exercise, the more you do, the better results you see. It’s important not to give up and be patient. You may need to take your skincare supplements between 8 -12 weeks before starting to see your results.
		Although you may start to see results within the first 10-14 days.
		Missing your daily dose regularly is where your results can fall behind. Implementing more of our tips below will help make taking supplements part of your routine just like cleansing, toning, and moisturizing.

		<h3><u>2. Habit Stacking</u></h3>
		<p class="section-text" style="text-align: justify;">
		Habit stacking is when you pair a new habit to an existing habit you already do every day. It’s an effective way of sticking to a routine and remembering to do it. 
		Take your supplements with lunch or an evening meal and consider them as part of a nutritious and healthy meal. Research shows that taking fat soluble vitamins (A, D E) are better absorbed when taking with a main meal that contains fats or oils.

		Put your skincare supplements where you can see them. Keep them on your desk at work and take them with lunch. Or when at home keep them visible on the kitchen counter, don’t hide them in a drawer.
