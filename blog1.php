		<u><h2>Daniel Bauer’s Top Tips On Dewy Makeup</h2></u><br>
            <p class="section-text" style="text-align: justify;">
              Dewy skin indirectly symbolises good health and an active lifestyle. The skin’s fresh and radiant appearance is a feature most women dream of having - but only a handful boast of.
			  There are two ways to achieve dewy skin - the natural route or with the help of makeup.The first option requires you to make some serious changes to your diet and exercise plan. Time and patience are both needed from your end. With makeup, however, dewy skin can be achieved in less than 5 minutes. 
			  The best part? You have Celebrity Makeup Artist, Daniel Bauer, to help you make your dreams come true!

		<u><h2>The Clean Start: Swap Your Makeup Remover in Spring</h2></u><br>
		
            <p class="section-text" style="text-align: justify;">
             During the cold winter months, we often switch to creamy cleansers and balms to remove makeup. Some people choose to return to soaps or foaming cleansers during the warmer months.
			 While this change can be lighter on the skin than heavy cleansing balms, keep in mind that foaming cleansers and soaps can sometimes strip and even dry out the skin.

					<b>1.</b> A great moisturizing face cleanser duo is jane iredale Beauty Prep Face Cleanserand Magic Mitt. The Beauty Prep Face Cleanser is an excellent alternative to traditional cleansers because it is a Micellar Water cleanser rather than soap based. Made from nourishing ingredients like Cucumber and Aloe, it won’t dry the skin, yet you’ll find its just as effective. 
					Micellar Water lifts dirt and impurities from skin gently and leaves a layer of soothing hydration that absorbs right in. 
					<br><br>
					<b>2.</b> The Magic Mitt is made from microfibers that are smaller than a human hair. They mimic the action of emulsification dissolving makeup and residue to get skin incredibly clean without upsetting the pH or drying the skin. When combined with the Beauty Prep Face Cleanser, the results of this face cleanser duo are amazing!
					<br><br>
					<b>3.</b> Warm up the Magic Mitt under warm water and apply a few drops of Beauty Prep Face Cleanser on top. Then gently scrub in a circular direction all over the face, including around the eyes and on the lips. Keep your Magic Mitt clean by washing it with soap after using and letting it air dry.
