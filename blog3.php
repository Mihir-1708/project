		<b><u><h2>How to Use The Skincare Makeup System</h2></u></b><br>
            <p class="section-text" style="text-align: justify;">
			We asked our employees how they use our Skincare Makeup System and how it fits into their makeup routine. Our 3-step system is designed to create a flawless, long-lasting and good-for-the-skin foundation base. First, start with Smooth Affair Brightening Face Primer to help makeup last longer and go on smoother.
			Then add coverage and sun protection with our #1 best-selling PurePressed Base Mineral Foundation. Finally, spritz your complexion with Pommisst Hydration Spray to help set your minerals and deliver antioxidant protection.

		Sami, our Sales Operations Coordinator, shares how she uses our Skincare Makeup System:<br>
		I’ve been a PurePressed Base user since 2015 and I don’t see myself straying anytime soon (or, ever!). Whether I am getting ready for work, a date night, or some fun in the sun, I don’t leave my house without applying. 
		I love that PurePressed Base is a 4-in-1 product: concealer, foundation, sunscreen and skincare. Not to mention, it is so easy and quick to apply!
		Every morning after completing my daily skincare routine, I prime my skin with Smooth Affair Brightening Face Primer. Aside from minimizing the appearance of pores and fine lines, it truly is the best base for my pressed powder and allows my makeup to last throughout the day.
		I always use The Handi Brush with my PurePressed Base in Radiant for a full-face application, followed by the Sculpting Brush for targeted camouflaging and lastly the Flocked Sponge for added coverage under my eyes. Of course, I must end with a few (or five!) spritzes of my favorite Hydration Spray, POMMISST. Not only is the scent so refreshing, but it is designed to set the minerals and provide a smooth, skin-like finish.
		After applying my foundation, I like to add a little color back to my skin. Lately my go-to combo has been the Glow Time Bronzer and Blush Sticks. Fervor provides the perfect amount of color to the apples of my cheeks and Scorch adds a beautiful, light contour.
		I always find myself reaching for the PureBrow Precision Pencil in Dark Brown. I love this brow pencil because it allows me to draw in a few hair-like strokes in sparse areas. Continuing with eyes, I apply a few swipes of Beyond Lash Mascara and lastly, I grab my favorite HydroPure Hyaluronic Acid Lip Gloss in Kir Royale to apply on my lips. This entire look takes me no longer than 5 minutes to complete in the morning and leaves me feeling like an elevated version of myself.
